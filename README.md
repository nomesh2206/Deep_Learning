# Deep_Learning
Basic Deep learning project using Keras
In this post, you will learn how to create a neural network model using the powerful Keras Python library for deep learning.

Specifically, we learn the six key steps in using Keras to create a neural network or deep learning model step-by-step, including:

1. How to load the data.
2. How to define a neural network in Keras.
3. How to compile a Keras model using the efficient numerical backend.
4. How to train a model on data.
5. How to evaluate a model on data.
6. How to make predictions with the model.
